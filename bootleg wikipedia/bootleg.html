          <p class="starter"><br><b>How do you want to be playing sports?</b></p>
          <p class="paragraphs"><br>If you want to play casual, you need to understand that you dont have to be good at a game/sport to be having fun! Fun comes in all shapes and sizes and if you're not having fun because you feel you're not good enough or because you just dont like the sport, you dont even have to play. The main part to take away from playing a sport for fun is that it's meant to be fun, so have fun! <br><br>Now, if you want to be playing sports competitvely(as in trying to beat others in the game), you'll need to put in the practice. Dont expect to be good at the sport after barely practicing because that never happens. We've provided some links to get you started and have tips if you want them but getting good at a sport requires practice and research. Different sports have different techniques and strategies but one thing that stays constant within all sports is the fact that you need to practice to get better. But by far the most important thing is that you need to enjoy playing the sport to really get better. Its not as easy to get better at a sport if you don't like playing it.</p>
          <p class="paragraphs"><br>All in all, a sport is a game. You can play it competitvely or you can play it casually but what matters is that you enjoy doing what you do.</p>

          <p class="starter"><br><b>Social skills are some of the hardest skills you can work on, so here are some ideas we have!</b></p>
          <p class="paragraphs"><br>As always, we have linked some reliable sources at the end of this section. <br><br>First off, one must understand that social skills are interacting and communicating with others. Social skills range from talking to someone online to body gestures. Moving on, the best thing to do in social interactions is treating everyone with respect and being friendly. Even if they dont respect you, you should show respect to them so as to not stoop to their level. Another thing some people forget is that you should treat someone the same way you would like to be treated. This can be very useful when communicating with anyone because people tend to like you more if you're nicer to them.</p>
          <p class="paragraphs"><br>Sometimes if you want to make more friends, you have to take the first step in talking to them. Don't just wait for the other person to approach you, that might never happen. Instead, go to them and just start talking about random things to see what you both have in common. Remember to not focus too much on yourself and get the other person involved in some chatting so as to have less of a one sided conversation and to get to know them better. If you dont want to be friends with someone, just remember that you probably dont want to make anyone angry at you because that could cause you all sorts of trouble.</p>
          <p class="paragraphs"><br>Lastly, you should try and keep in contact with people you meet so you can talk to them again and stay friends with them. If you just stop talking with someone that bond will eventually just die and when you meet again, you'll have to start all over.</p>
